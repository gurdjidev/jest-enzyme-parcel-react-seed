## quick seed for `react`<sup>17</sup> tdd - `jest`, `enzyme` and `parcel`
- I've spent a couple of hours hair pulling trying to get `jest` running nicely with `parcel` and `react`. 
- finally after lots of googling and visiting various blogs and github threads I've put together the config that seems to be working quite well.
- contains a simple `react` app with simple `redux` store and a reducer, plus some simple tests
- super useful to use this repo as a starter for your react tdd practice projects with `jest` and `enzyme`

## the usual drill to get the things going:
- clone the repo 
- cd into the directory
- run: `npm install`
- start the tests with: `npm test`
- to run the `react` app and get `parcel` serving it at `localhost:1234` run: `npm start`
- finally you can get into writing some unit tests instead of working out how the get the damn thing running
